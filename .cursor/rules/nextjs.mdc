## Communication Protocol

### Next.js Context Assessment

Initialize Next.js development by understanding project requirements.

Next.js context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "nextjs-developer",
  "request_type": "get_nextjs_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Next.js context needed: application type, rendering strategy, data sources, SEO requirements, and deployment target."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Next.js development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Planning

Design optimal Next.js architecture.

Planning priorities:

- App structure
- Rendering strategy
- Data architecture
- API design
- Performance targets
- SEO strategy
- Deployment plan
- Monitoring setup

Architecture design:

- Define routes
- Plan layouts
- Design data flow
- Set performance goals
- Create API structure
- Configure caching
- Setup deployment
- Document patterns

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build full-stack Next.js applications.

Implementation approach:

- Create app structure
- Implement routing
- Add server components
- Setup data fetching
- Optimize performance
- Write tests
- Handle errors
- Deploy application

Next.js patterns:

- Component architecture
- Data fetching patterns
- Caching strategies
- Performance optimization
- Error handling
- Security implementation
- Testing coverage
- Deployment automation

Next.js Components

- **CRITICAL: Always keep `page.tsx` as Server Components** - Never add 'use client' to page.tsx files
- **NEVER use client features in Server Components** - No hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.), no event handlers, no browser APIs
- Use Server Components by default for all page components and layouts
- Mark client components explicitly with 'use client' directive at the top of the file
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback if component is heavy
- Prefer name export in client components
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Place static content and interfaces at file end
- **Server Components are for**: Data fetching, static content, server-side logic
- **Client Components are for**: Interactivity, hooks, event handlers, browser APIs

Forms and Validation

- Use Zod for form validation
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Handle form errors appropriately
- Show loading states during form submission

Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "nextjs-developer",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "routes_created": 24,
    "api_endpoints": 18,
    "lighthouse_score": 98,
    "build_time": "45s"
  }
}
```

## CRITICAL RULES FOR SERVER COMPONENTS

### Page Components (`page.tsx`)

- **NEVER add 'use client' to page.tsx files**
- **ALWAYS keep page.tsx as Server Components**
- Use async functions for data fetching: `export default async function Page()`
- Fetch data directly in the component: `const data = await fetchData()`
- Pass data to client components via props when interactivity is needed

### Server Component Restrictions

- **NO React hooks** (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
- **NO event handlers** (onClick, onChange, onSubmit, etc.)
- **NO browser APIs** (window, document, localStorage, etc.)
- **NO client-side libraries** that depend on browser environment
- **NO dynamic imports** that require client-side execution

### When to Use Client Components

- Only when you need interactivity (buttons, forms, inputs)
- Only when you need React hooks or browser APIs
- Only when you need event handlers
- Create separate `.tsx` files with 'use client' directive
- Import and use client components within server components

### Best Practices

- Keep the majority of your app as Server Components
- Use Client Components sparingly for interactive elements only
- Pass server-fetched data as props to client components
- Use Suspense boundaries around client components when needed
- Leverage Server Actions for form submissions and mutations
